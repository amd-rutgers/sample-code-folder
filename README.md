My `Code` folder
====================

This is an example of how you might organize your work. There are millions of ways to do this, and I encourage you to find the one that works best for you!

One thing to keep in mind, what we usually call *folders* are called *directories* in computer-speak.

Folder Structure
----------------

So here's what the structure of my `Code` folder looks like:

```
2B
	_Notes
		Class01.txt
		Class02.txt
	_Tools
		SiteTemplate.zip
	LinkedVerse
		linked-verse
			[ .. code for this project ]
	Portfolio
		_Notes
		01_Research
		02_Design
		03_Build
			portfolio-site
				[ .. code for this projec ]

```


Naming Conventions
------------------

There are some standard types of naming conventions you'll often see:

* `TitleCase`
* `CamelCase`
* `snake_case`
* `kebab-case`

A few notes on my naming conventions:

* For project folders I use `TitleCase` (`Portfolio`, `LinkedVerse`)
* For other utility folders I add an underscore (`_`) at the beginning (`_Notes`, `_Tools`).
* For larger projects that require more organization, I use numbered folders based on each phase of design (`01_Research`, `02_Design`, `03_Build`)
* For folders that contain actual code for projects. I use `kebab-case` for the folder name.
